Have you ever wanted to just send a URL or string of text to your phone but there seems to be no convinient way to do it? 
Well along with run-on sentinces I have the solution for you. PushNote is a simple web UI that sends any text you input as a notification to your phone. Links work great too, just put the link in the link section, when the notification pops up then click it and you will go straight to that URL.
