Have you ever wanted to just send a URL or string of text to your phone but there seems to be no convinient way to do it? Well along with run-on sentinces I have the solution for you. PushNote! PushNote is a simple webui that takes any text you give it and sends a notification to your phone with it. Links work great too, just put the link in the link section, when the notification pops up then click it and you will go straight to that URL.
